                <p>The use of services from Azoncode Ltd constitutes agreement to these terms.</p>
                <p><strong>1.) Account Setup / Email on file</strong><br />
                    We will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partner(s)
                    have screened the order(s) in case of fraud. It is your responsibility to provide us with an
                    email address which is not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse
                    issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this
                    purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date
                    at all times. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of
                    your account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to
                    provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the
                    purchase. If you fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in
                    nature and be denied.<br />
                    <strong>Transfers</strong><br />
                    Our transfers team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers
                    are provided as a courtesy service, and we can’t make guarantees regarding the availability,
                    possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is
                    configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary
                    format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account
                    data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of
                    data from an old host.<br />
                    The free transfer services are available for 30 days from your sign up date. Transfers outside
                    of the 30 day free period will incur a charge; please contact a member of the transfers
                    department with specific details to receive a price quote.
                </p>

                    of Florida, the State of Texas, and the United States of America apply.<br />
                    The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless AzonCode from any claims resulting from the
                    use of our services.<br />
                    Use of our services to infringe upon any copyright or trademark is prohibited. This includes but
                    is not limited to unauthorized copying of music, books, photographs, or any other copyrighted
                    work. The offer of sale of any counterfeit merchandise of a trademark holder will result in the
                    immediate termination of your account. Any account found to be in violation of another’s
                    copyright will be expeditiously removed, or access to the material disabled. Any account found
                    to be in repeated violation of copyright laws will be suspended and/or terminated from our
                    hosting. If you believe that your copyright or trademark is being infringed upon, please email
                    <a href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a> with the information required. If the

                <p>AzonCode services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided
                    only for authorized customer use. AzonCode systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes,
                    including to ensure that use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate
                    protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and
                    operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used
                    for authorized purposes. Use of AzonCode system(s) constitutes consent to monitoring for these
                    purposes.<br />
                    We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Any material that, in our judgment, is
                    obscene, threatening, illegal, or violates our terms of service in any manner may be removed
                    from our servers (or otherwise disabled), with or without notice.<br />
                    Failure to respond to email from our abuse department within 48 hours may result in the
                    suspension or termination of your services. All abuse issues must be dealt with via
                    troubleticket/email and will have a response within 48 hours.<br />
                    If in doubt regarding the acceptability of your site or service, please contact us at <a
                        href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a> and we will be happy to assist
                    you.<br />
                    Potential harm to minors is strictly forbidden, including but not limited to child pornography
                    or content perceived to be child pornography (Lolita):<br />
                    Any site found to host child pornography or linking to child pornography will be suspended
                    immediately without notice.<br />
                    Resellers: we will suspend the site in question and will notify you so you may terminate the
                    account. We will further monitor your activity; more than one infraction of this type may result
                    in the immediate termination of your account.<br />
                    Direct customers: Your services will be terminated with or without notice.<br />
                    Violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.<br />
                    <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account
                        are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of installation
                        method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive
                        as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account.
                        This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. It is required
                        that you use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended
                        until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords
                        from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will
                        notify you and allow time for you to change/update your password.</strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>3.) Zero Tolerance Spam Policy</strong><br />
                    We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail, bulk emailing, and spam.
                    &#8220;Safe lists&#8221; and purchased lists will be treated as spam. Any user who sends out
                    spam will have their account terminated with or without notice.<br />
                    Sites advertised via SPAM (Spamvertised) may not be hosted on our servers. This provision
                    includes, but is not limited to SPAM sent via fax, email, instant messaging, or
                    usenet/newsgroups. No organization or entity listed in the <a
                        href="http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/index.lasso"><strong>ROKSO</strong></a> may be hosted on
                    our servers. Any account which results in our IP space being blacklisted will be immediately
                    suspended and/or terminated.<br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to require changes or disable as necessary any web site, account,
                    database, or other component that does not comply with its established policies, or to make any
                    such modifications in an emergency at its sole discretion.<br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to charge the holder of the account used to send any unsolicited
                    e-mail a clean up fee or any charges incurred for blacklist removal. This cost of the clean up
                    fee is entirely at the discretion of AzonCode<strong>.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>4.) Payment Information</strong><br />
                    You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from AzonCode, in advance of
                    the time period during which such services are provided. You agree that until and unless you
                    notify AzonCode of your desire to cancel any or all services received, those services will be
                    billed on a recurring basis. This includes when accounts are suspended. When an account is
                    suspended, invoices will not automatically be generated. However, after the customer notifies
                    AzonCode of his or intent to resume service, invoices will be manually generated and payment
                    expected for the time the account was suspended.<br />
                    Cancellations must be done in writing to our <a href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">Contact
                        mail</a>. Once we receive your cancellation and have confirmed all necessary information
                    with you via e-mail, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been
                    canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject
                    for your reference, and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic
                    &#8220;Your request has been received&#8230;&#8221; email with a tracking number. An employee
                    will confirm your request (and process your cancellation) shortly thereafter. If you do not hear
                    back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after
                    submitting your cancellation, please contact us immediately via phone. We require that
                    cancellations of service are done through the online form to (a) confirm your identity, (b)
                    confirm in writing you are prepared for all files/emails to be removed, and (c) document the
                    request. This process reduces the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and
                    ensures you are aware that the files, emails, and account may be removed immediately after a
                    cancellation request is processed.<br />
                    As a client of AzonCode, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up
                    to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. AzonCode provides a 10 day grace period from
                    the time the invoice is generated and when it must be paid. Any invoice that is outstanding for
                    10 days and not paid will result in a $10 late fee and/or an account suspension until account
                    balance has been paid in full. The $10 late fee is applied in addition to whatever else is owed
                    to AzonCode for services rendered. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has
                    been received.<br />
                    It is the customer&#8217;s responsibility to notify our sales team via email at <a
                        href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a> after paying for a domain renewal and
                    to ensure the email is received and acted upon. Domain renewal notices and invoices are provided
                    as a courtesy reminder and AzonCode cannot be held responsible for failure to renew a domain or
                    failure to notify a customer about a domain&#8217;s renewal.<br />
                    Invoices that have been paid more than once with multiple PayPal Subscriptions can only be added
                    as credit towards the account and cannot be refunded via PayPal. If you require assistance with
                    this provision, please contact <a href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a><br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to change the monthly, annual payment amount and any other charges
                    at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>5.) Backups and Data Loss</strong><br />
                    Your use of this service is at your sole risk. Our backup service is provided to you as a
                    courtesy. AzonCode is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree
                    to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate
                    backup of files and data stored on AzonCode servers. Backups will not be provided for accounts
                    that have been suspended or terminated for any reason unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
                    AzonCode.</p>
                <p><strong>6.) Cancellations and Refunds</strong><br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to cancel, suspend, or otherwise restrict access to the account at
                    any time with or without notice.<br />
                    <strong>Any abuse of our staff in any medium or format will result in the suspension or
                        termination of your services.</strong><br />
                    AzonCode gives you an unconditional 30 day money back guarantee on managed shared hosting, and
                    reseller solutions for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with
                    PayPal.<br />
                    The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to
                    the hosting account:<br />
                    Bank Wire Transfers<br />
                    Western Union Payments<br />
                    Checks<br />
                    Money orders
                </p>
                <p>There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, install fees for custom software,
                    or domain name purchases. Refund requests for shared and reseller accounts after the initial 30
                    days will be refunded on a prorated basis of any unused time.<br />
                    Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you&#8217;ve had an account
                    with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you
                    have opened a second account with us.<br />
                    <strong>Violations of the Terms of Service will waive the refund policy.</strong>

                    <li><strong> Resource Usage</strong><br />
                        User may not:<br />
                        a) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous
                        activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP,
                        etc.<br />
                        b) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server.
                        This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.<br />
                        c) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared
                        servers.<br />
                        d) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.<br />
                        e) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents
                        off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.<br />
                        f) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities<br />
                        g) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc<br />
                        h) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes When using PHP include functions
                        for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of
                        include(&#8220;http://yourdomain.com/include.php&#8221;) use
                        include(&#8220;include.php&#8221;)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>7b.) INODES </strong><br />
                    The use of more than 250,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in a warning
                    first, and if no action is taken future suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 50,000
                    inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid over-usage. Every file
                    (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.<br />
                    Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that
                    constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of
                    thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension. The
                    primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address
                    enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of
                    messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable
                    your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose &#8220;Mail&#8221;, then &#8220;Default
                    Address&#8221;, &#8220;Set Default Address&#8221;, and then type in: :fail: No such user here.
                </p>
                <p><strong>7c.) Backup Limit </strong><br />
                    Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site
                    weekly backup with the the exception of Databases continuing to be backed up. All data will
                    continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive which helps protect against data loss in the event
                    of a drive failure.</p>
                <p><strong>8.) Bandwidth Usage</strong><br />
                    You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting
                    package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to
                    suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more
                    bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher
                    level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages.
                    Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p>
                <p><strong>9a.) Money back Guarantee</strong><br />
                    On dedicated servers and collocation no full refund will be honored &#8212; the 30 day money
                    back guarantee does not apply. We reserve the right to refund a prorated amount or no refund at
                    all.<br />
                    Each of AzonCode’s managed shared and reseller servers carry a 30 day unconditional money back
                    guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 30
                    days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is
                    only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to dedicated servers,
                    administrative fees, install fees for custom software, or domain name purchases.</p>
                <p><strong>9b.) Uptime Guarantee</strong><br />
                    If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you
                    may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of
                    AzonCode dependent upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not
                    be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor&#8217;s network
                    capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from
                    the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by
                    other individual services. To request a credit, please contact <a
                        href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a> with justification. All requests must
                    be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared / reseller solutions.
                    Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the
                    amount of time the server is down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.</p>
                <p><strong>10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</strong><br />
                    Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. AzonCode does not provide support to our
                    Reseller&#8217;s Clients. If a reseller&#8217;s client contacts us, we reserve the right to
                    place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their
                    client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients&#8217; behalf for
                    security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under
                    their reseller account and the actions of their clients&#8217;. AzonCode will hold any reseller
                    responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.</p>
                <p><strong>11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semidedicated Servers</strong><br />
                    Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you
                    must use a reseller account. Semi-dedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your
                    own backups.</p>
                <p><strong>12.) Dedicated Servers</strong><br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file
                    is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the
                    responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root
                    password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password
                    resets. AzonCode reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative
                    actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is
                    the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. You may
                    purchase an additional hard drive and maintain backups to it as the most simple solution. Please
                    contact <a href="mailto:info@azoncode.com">info@azoncode.com</a> if you wish to obtain a
                    secondary hard drive. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.</p>
                <p><strong>13.) Price Change</strong><br />
                    The amount you pay for hosting will never increase from the date of purchase. We reserve the
                    right to change prices listed on <a href="http://www.azoncode.com">www.azoncode.com</a> , and
                    the right to increase the amount of resources given to plans at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>14.) Coupons</strong><br />
                    Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts *or first-time customers* only
                    and may not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If
                    you have signed up using a particular domain, you may not resign up for that domain using
                    another coupon at a later date. Any account found in violation of these policies will be
                    reviewed by our sales department and the appropriate invoices will be added to the account.
                    Coupon abuse will not be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of the
                    account.</p>
                <p><strong>15a.) Indemnification</strong><br />
                    Customer agrees that it shall defend, indemnify, save and hold AzonCode harmless from any and
                    all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees
                    asserted against AzonCode, its agents, its customers, officers and employees, that may arise or
                    result from any service provided or performed or agreed to be performed or any product sold by
                    customer, its agents, employees or assigns. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
                    harmless AzonCode against liabilities arising out of; (1) any injury to person or property
                    caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed in connection with AzonCode; (2) any
                    material supplied by customer infringing or allegedly infringing on the proprietary rights of a
                    third party; (3) copyright infringement and (4) any defective products sold to customers from
                    AzonCode’s server.</p>
                <p>15b.) Arbitration By using any AzonCode services, you agree to submit to binding arbitration. If
                    any disputes or claims arise against AzonCode or its subsidiaries, such disputes will be handled
                    by an arbitrator of AzonCode&#8217;s choice. An arbitrator from the American Arbitration
                    Association or the National Arbitration Forum will be selected in the state of Texas.
                    Arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the
                    applicable rules. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The
                    arbitrator&#8217;s award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and
                    not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. You are
                    also responsible for any and all costs related to such arbitration.</p>
                <p>16.) Disclaimer<br />
                    AzonCode shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. AzonCode makes no
                    warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for services we provide. AzonCode disclaims any
                    warranty or merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This includes loss of data
                    resulting from delays, no deliveries, wrong delivery, and any and all service interruptions
                    caused by AzonCode and its employees.</p>
                <p>17.) Disclosure to law enforcement<br />
                    AzonCode may disclose any subscriber information to law enforcement agencies without further
                    consent or notification to the subscriber upon lawful request from such agencies. We will
                    cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies.</p>
                <p>18.) Changes to the TOS<br />
                    AzonCode reserves the right to revise its policies at any time without notice</p>
                <p>19.) Free and Promotional Items/Services<br />
                    For all free and promotional items/Services, the service product will expire after 3 months (for
                    Hosting accounts); Client must switch to a paid plan available.</p>
                <p>20.) All services provided by AzonCode may only be used for lawful purposes. The laws of the
                    State of Florida, the State of Texas, and the United States of America apply. The ordinance and
                    guidelines of ministry of communication and information technology of Bangladesh, The laws of
                    the State of Florida, the State of Texas, and the United States of America apply.</p>
